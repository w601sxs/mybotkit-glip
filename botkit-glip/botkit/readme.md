Botkit is a Node.js module, and works with Node and npm.


### **Botkit Studio**

Botkit Studio is a dashboard and IDE designed to super-charge Botkit. It includes a web-based interface for building and managing dialog, an activity console, third party integrations, and advanced analytics tools like customer segmenting, conversion funnels, and user retention metrics.

Sign up for a free Botkit Studio account, and it will guide you through the process to create, configure and deploy your Botkit app!

**[![Sign up for Botkit Studio](docs/studio.png)](https://studio.botkit.ai/signup?code=readme)**


### **Remix on Glitch**

Want to dive right in? [Remix one of our starter kits on Glitch](https://glitch.com/botkit). You'll start with a fully functioning app that you can edit and run from the browser!

### **Command Line Interface**

The best way to get started locally with Botkit is by installing our command line tool, and using it to create a new Botkit project. This will install and configure a starter kit for you!


> ### [Slack Bot Starter Kit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack)
> The Slack starter kit contains everything you need to create a multi-team Slack application,
suitable for internal use or submission to [Slack's app store.](https://slack.com/apps)
> #### [![Remix on Glitch](docs/glitch.png)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack)

> ### [Cisco Spark Bot Starter Kit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-ciscospark)
> Build a bot inside Cisco Spark's collaboration and messaging platform. Bots built with the starter kit
are ready to submit to [Cisco Spark's Depot app store](https://depot.ciscospark.com/).
> #### [![Remix on Glitch](docs/glitch.png)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/howdyai/botkit-starter-ciscospark)

> ### [Facebook Bot Starter Kit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-facebook)
> The Facebook starter kit contains all the code necessary to stand up a Facebook bot on either Facebook Messenger, or Facebook Work Chat. With just a few pieces of configuration, set up a bot that automatically responds to messages sent to your Facebook page.
> #### [![Remix on Glitch](docs/glitch.png)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/howdyai/botkit-starter-facebook)
If you intend to create a bot that lives in Glip, [follow these instructions for configuring your Glip bot](readme-glip.md#getting-started).

If you intend to create a bot that lives inside a Twilio IP Messaging client, [follow these instructions for configuring your app](readme-twilioipm.md#getting-started).
> #### [![Remix on Glitch](docs/glitch.png)](https://glitch.com/~botkit-facebook)

```
npm install -g botkit
botkit new
```

### **Start from Scratch**

You can also add Botkit into an existing Node application.

First, add it to your project:
>>>>>>> upstream/master

```
npm install --save botkit
```

Then, add Botkit to your application code:

```
var Botkit = require('botkit');

var controller = Botkit.slackbot(configuration);

controller.hears('hello','direct_message', function(bot, message) {
    bot.reply(message,'Hello yourself!');
});
```

[Review the documentation](docs/readme.md) to learn how to configure Botkit's controller to work with the messaging platform of your choice.

# Build Your Bot

The goal of Botkit is to make it easier and more fun to build software that talks and works like a robot! Building a bot should feel cool, and not too technically complicated.

Botkit handles all the nitty gritty details like
API calls, session management and authentication,
allowing you to focus on building COOL FEATURES for your
bot using middleware and event handlers.

The toolkit is designed to provide meaningful building blocks for creating conversational user interfaces - with functions like `hears()`, `ask()`, and `reply()` that do what they say they do.

### Hearing Keywords

Most bots do their thing by listening for keywords, phrases or patterns in messages from users. Botkit has a special event handler called `hears()` that makes it easy to configure your bot to listen for this type of trigger.

```
controller.hears(['string','pattern .*',new RegExp('.*','i')],'message_received,other_event',function(bot, message) {

  // do something!
  bot.reply(message, 'I heard a message.')

});
```

[Read more about hearing things &rsaquo;](docs/readme.md#matching-patterns-and-keywords-with-hears)

### Responding to Events

Bots can respond to non-verbal events as well, like when a new user joins a channel, a file gets uploaded, or a button gets clicked. These events are handled using an event handling pattern that should look familiar. Most events in Botkit can be replied to like normal messages.

```
controller.on('channel_join', function(bot, message) {

  bot.reply(message,'Welcome to the channel!');

});
```

[See a full list of events and more information about handling them &rsaquo;](docs/readme.md#responding-to-events)

### Middleware

In addition to taking direct action in response to a certain message or type of event, Botkit can also take passive action on messages as they move through the application using middlewares. Middleware functions work by changing messages, adding new fields, firing alternate events, and modifying or overriding the behavior of Botkit's core features.

Middleware can be used to adjust how Botkit receives, processes, and sends messages. [Here is a list of available middleware endpoints](docs/readme-pipeline.md).

```
// Log every message recieved
controller.middleware.receive.use(function(bot, message, next) {

  // log it
  console.log('RECEIVED: ', message);

  // modify the message
  message.logged = true;

  // continue processing the message
  next();

});

// Log every message sent
controller.middleware.send.use(function(bot, message, next) {

  // log it
  console.log('SENT: ', message);

  // modify the message
  message.logged = true;

  // continue processing the message
  next();

});
```
